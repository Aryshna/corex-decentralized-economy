# How to Contribute to Corex: A Meritocratic and Collaborative Journey

Welcome to Corex! We are thrilled that you're interested in contributing to this groundbreaking project. Corex's core philosophy is built on meritocracy, fairness, and community-driven value. This applies not only to the economic system we are building but also to how we develop it.

## Our Contribution & Ownership Model

Corex operates under a unique meritocratic ownership model, fully aligned with its core principles:

**Every contribution is a "Work Cell" or "Recognition Cell" within the project's development itself. Ownership (e.g., shares in the future Corex Foundation or protocol ownership) will be dynamically allocated based on the value you contribute, as assessed by the community of contributors.**

*   **Initial Stake & Visionary's Role:** As the visionary lead and creator of the Corex concept, Aryshna's foundational contribution is the idea itself, the comprehensive Whitepaper, and the initial architectural design. **The Visionary Lead claims no pre-allocated financial share or Corex units for this initial creation.** Any Corex acquired by the Visionary Lead in the future will be through their active, ongoing contributions and work within the project, assessed by the community, exactly like any other contributor. This commitment underscores Corex's absolute meritocratic principle from its very inception.
*   **Contribution Valuation:** All code, design, documentation, research, and community management efforts will be submitted as "Work Cells" within the development process.
*   **Community Assessment:** Other contributors will evaluate these "Work Cells" based on their quality, complexity, and impact on the project, similar to how Corex assesses user work.
*   **Dynamic Ownership:** Your share of the project's ownership will correlate directly with the aggregated "Community Score" of your contributions relative to others. This creates a truly meritocratic and continuously updated ownership structure.
*   **Transparency:** All contributions and their assessed value will be publicly visible and auditable within this GitHub repository and potentially on a dedicated Corex development chain.

## Getting Started

1.  **Read the `README.md`:** Understand the core vision, philosophy, and key innovations of Corex.
2.  **Explore the Documentation:** Review the [Corex Whitepaper (v2.0 - detailed version)](./docs/Corex_Whitepaper.pdf) and other documentation in the `/docs` folder to grasp the project's architecture and design.
3.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code (if applicable):** If you plan to contribute code, look at the `/src` folder (once available) to understand the current code structure and standards.

## How to Make a Contribution

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `corex-decentralized-economy` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aryshna/corex-decentralized-economy.git
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch:** For each new feature, bug fix, or contribution, create a new branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your contribution. Ensure your work adheres to our [Coding Standards](#coding-standards) (to be defined).
5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages.
6.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the original `corex-decentralized-economy` repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it.
    *   Provide a detailed description of your contribution.
    *   **Crucially, describe your contribution as a "Work Cell":**
        *   **Work Cell ID (e.g., proposed):** A unique identifier for your contribution.
        *   **Work Description:** A clear explanation of what you did.
        *   **Success Criteria:** How your contribution should be evaluated.
        *   **Impact on Project:** How this Work Cell benefits Corex.
8.  **PR Review & Work Cell Assessment:**
    *   Your PR will be reviewed by other contributors and project leads.
    *   **The review process will also serve as the "Community Assessment" for your Work Cell.** Reviewers will evaluate your contribution based on its quality, complexity, and impact.
    *   Feedback will be provided, and you may need to make revisions.
9.  **Merge & Ownership Allocation:**
    *   Once your PR is approved and merged, your Work Cell's score will be finalized.
    *   This score will contribute to your overall ownership allocation in the Corex project, calculated periodically.

## Coding Standards (To be defined)

We will define specific coding standards, testing guidelines, and documentation requirements as the project evolves.
